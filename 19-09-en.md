## Core Modules
### I. Policy & Path
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19 markets price front-loaded easing — a ~25 bp cut at the Oct 29 meeting and about -57.5 bp cumulatively over the next three FOMC meetings — even as the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) is running slightly above the target midpoint and reserve pressures have narrowed the IORB–EFFR spread.

Key evidence:
- EFFR = 4.33% on 2025-09-19, above the target range midpoint (4.125%) and the 4.00–4.25% target band (EFFR minus midpoint = +20.5 bp).
- IORB–EFFR spread = -18 bp on 2025-09-19, flagged as reserve pressure and noted to have narrowed by roughly 25 bp over the prior 20 days.
- CME FedWatch (2025-09-19) shows a 94.07% probability of a 25 bp cut at the 2025-10-29 meeting (expected post‑meeting EFFR ≈ 3.89%; most‑probable target midpoint 3.875%).
- Expected cumulative policy path over the next three meetings is -57.517 bp (meetings on 2025-10-29, 2025-12-10, 2026-01-28), characterized as front‑loaded easing.

Interpretation: These readings combine high‑frequency market prices (CME Fed funds futures) and FRED-reported rates; the dating is 2025-09-19 and sources are CME/FRED via ETL. Market-implied probabilities and the short-term path are high-confidence indicators of expected Fed action in the near term, while the EFFR and IORB spread reflect operational funding conditions that can shift quickly. The fact that EFFR is modestly above the midpoint and the IORB–EFFR spread has compressed suggests temporary settlement or reserve effects that could influence day-to-day EFFR volatility even as policy expectations move toward cuts.

What to watch:
- Oct 29, 2025 FOMC outcome and whether the priced 25 bp cut occurs.
- Changes in the IORB–EFFR spread and IORB itself (reserve pressure reversal would reduce EFFR volatility).
- Repricing in FedWatch probabilities ahead of the Dec 10 and Jan 28 meetings and any Fed communication that alters the front‑loaded easing narrative.

### II. Employment
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19, the US labor market remains resilient but shows clear signs of slowing momentum rather than tipping into recession.

- Payrolls are still expanding but momentum has slowed: annualized 3‑month payroll growth is 0.22% versus 0.48% over 6 months (data to 2025-09-19); a LABOR_SLOWING signal is flagged.
- Initial jobless claims are low and modestly improving versus the recent average: latest weekly claims 231,000 (2025-09-19) with a 4‑week moving average of 240,000, down 3,000 over four weeks but up 9,000 year‑over‑year.
- The Sahm rule is well below the recession trigger: Sahm = 0.133 pp as of 2025-09-19 (recession signal historically at ≥0.5 pp); the unemployment 3‑month moving average is 4.2% with a 12‑month minimum of 4.07%.
- Twelve‑month context shows slower-than-average payroll acceleration (average 12‑month annualized 3‑month gain ~0.95%).

Interpretation: Weekly claims provide timely, high‑frequency signals while payrolls (monthly) are subject to revision; the Sahm rule is a reliable rule-of-thumb for recession onset but is lagging and requires a large rise in unemployment to trigger. Together (data dated 2025-09-19) the indicators point to continued positive job growth with cooling momentum, not an economy in immediate labor‑market distress.

What to watch:
- Whether 3‑month payroll momentum decelerates further or stabilizes in coming months.
- Trends in the 4‑week average of initial claims — sustained increases above recent averages would raise downside risk.
- Any sizeable rise in the unemployment 3‑month moving average that would push the Sahm measure toward 0.5 pp.

### III. Inflation
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19 core inflation is running near 2.8–3.0% with a small positive short-term momentum and market inflation expectations remaining broadly anchored around 2.3–2.4%.

Key evidence:
- Core PCE (YoY) 2.88% and 3‑month annualized 2.98% on 2025-09-19; three‑month momentum = +0.10 percentage point (slightly positive).
- CPI core (YoY) 3.11% versus PCE core 2.88% — CPI leads PCE by 0.23 percentage point as of 2025-09-19.
- 5‑year breakeven 2.44% and 5y/5y forward 2.32% (2025-09-19); market signal flagged as forward-anchored and sits at the 60th percentile over the five‑year window.

Interpretation: These are FRED readings dated 2025-09-19; reliability is moderate-to-high for headline and core aggregates but short-term movements can reflect volatile components (energy, seasonal shelter flows) and index-weight differences between CPI and PCE. The small positive core PCE momentum (+0.10ppt) indicates a modest pickup over the last three months rather than a sustained reacceleration; the CPI–PCE gap (~0.23pp) highlights measurement and composition differences rather than a large underlying divergence. Market breakevens and the 5y/5y forward around 2.3–2.4% signal that inflation expectations remain largely anchored.

What to watch:
- Next core PCE monthly release to see if three‑month annualized gains persist or fade.
- CPI vs PCE gap and components (shelter, services) that drive the core divergence.
- Moves in 5y and 5y/5y breakevens and Fed communications that could shift expectation anchoring.

### IV. GDP Growth
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19 U.S. growth is positive but mixed — real GDP is up 2.8% YoY with a small quarterly slip, GDI and private investment show stronger momentum, while housing is weak and net exports remain a sizable drag.

- Real GDP YoY 2.8% (latest 2025-09-19); quarterly change -0.1 pp.
- Nominal GDI YoY 5.42% (2025-09-19) with a GDP vs GDI divergence of -1.5 pp (GDP QoQ SAAR 3.3% vs GDI 4.8%), implying stronger income-side growth than product-side.
- NIPA statistical discrepancy elevated at $7,608.4 bn SAAR (2025-09-19), meaning measured GDI exceeds measured GDP and signaling measurement uncertainty.
- Real private investment re-accelerating (YoY +0.38%, 2‑q ann. +3.31%, 2025-09-19) while housing activity is weak (housing composite -8.4% YoY, inventory 9.2 months, 2025-09-19).
- External sector mixed: real exports YoY +2.05% and imports YoY +1.27% (2025-09-19), but real net exports remain deeply negative at -$1,029.0 bn (chained 2017 USD SAAR), with only a small four-quarter improvement.

Interpretation: The headline picture is one of modest underlying growth with uneven internal composition. Stronger GDI and private-investment momentum point to resilient demand, but the large statistical discrepancy weakens confidence in a clean GDP signal — treat the product-side growth read with caution. Housing weakness and a persistent net-exports drag constrain upside. Data are sourced to FRED/BEA and dated to the latest releases as of 2025-09-19; many series are SAAR or YoY as noted.

What to watch:
- BEA GDP/GDI revisions and whether the statistical discrepancy narrows in upcoming releases.
- Private investment quarterly path (capex details) to confirm re-acceleration.
- Housing permits, sales and inventory trends for signs of balance-sheet driven demand shifts.
- Next exports/imports releases and trade-price moves that could alter the net-exports drag.

### VI. Company Earnings
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19, equities are at multi-year highs while corporate profits growth is cooling, creating a divergence between market levels and underlying profit momentum.

- S&P 500 at 6,631.96 on 2025-09-19, flagged as a high breakout and at the 100th percentile over the past five years; short-run (20-day) change reported at +261.79%.
- Corporate profits YoY = 4.31% (data as of 2025-09-19) but two-quarter annualized momentum = -1.25%, flagged as PROFITS_COOLING.
- Corporate profits level (SAAR) = $3,981.85 billion and corporate tax (SAAR) = $3,266.21 billion, with momentum differential of -5.56 percentage points.

Interpretation: The market is pricing strong confidence—reflected in a breakout S&P 500 on 2025-09-19—while the underlying profit cycle shows decelerating growth and negative recent momentum. The signals come from different vintages and frequencies: equity prices are high-frequency and forward-looking, corporate profits are quarterly BEA NIPA data that capture realized earnings and tax flows. Data sources are FRED/BEA for profits and FRED for the index; the profit momentum signal suggests caution on earnings expansion despite elevated valuations.

What to watch:
- Upcoming quarterly profit releases and BEA updates for confirmation or reversal of the recent profits momentum decline.
- Any sustained divergence between price action and profit momentum that could signal valuation re-rating or an earnings-driven market correction.

## Extended Modules
### VII. Liquidity & Money
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19 liquidity is effectively neutral — no net easing/tightening signals — while money growth is moderate and the real yield curve remains steep.

- The Fed liquidity composite is neutral on 2025-09-19 (indicator = 0); the Fed balance sheet fell about $9.8bn over the prior 4 weeks and the Treasury General Account rose ~$0.2bn.
- M2 YoY growth is 4.82% with a 3-month annualized pace of 5.82% and an M2 level of $22,115.4bn (as of 2025-09-19); reverse repo rate is 4.0%.
- Short-end volatility: the 6‑month Treasury is 3.8% after a large 20‑day decline of 31 bps (as of 2025-09-19), signaling recent downward pressure at the front end.
- Real yields remain elevated at the long end and have fallen recently: real 5y 1.19%, 10y 1.68%, 30y 2.40%, with a 5s–30s real slope of 121 bp (all as of 2025-09-19) and roughly 20–26 bp declines across tenors over the prior 20 days.

Interpretation: The suite of indicators (FRED-based balance sheet, RRP, TGA and money aggregates) points to a neutral liquidity backdrop on 2025-09-19, not a pronounced easing or tightening. M2 growth is moderate but showing positive short-run momentum (3‑month annualized = 5.82%), which can support nominal spending absent offsetting policy moves. At the same time, the short end has eased recently (large 20‑day drop in the 6‑month rate), while real yields and the 5s–30s real slope remain steep, suggesting term-premia or real-rate differentials persist at the long end. Data are timely and from standard FRED series, though weekly swings in RRP/TGA and short-end Treasury moves can create transient signals.

What to watch:
- Fed balance sheet 4‑week changes and RRP usage for any drift away from neutrality.
- TGA balance moves that could temporarily tighten liquidity.
- Short-end UST moves and dealer funding conditions after large 20‑day swings.
- M2 momentum (3‑month annualized) for signals of changing nominal demand.

### VIII. USD & Commodities
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19 the dollar has eased slightly over the past 20 days while oil prices remain low in their five‑year distributions — Brent is up modestly short‑term but WTI is on a weekly downtrend and down sharply over the last three months.

- USD trade‑weighted index 120.49 (2025-09-19); 20‑day change −0.56%; 5‑yr percentile ~48 (FRED).
- Brent spot USD 67.88/bbl (2025-09-19); 20‑day change +0.58%; 5‑yr percentile ~17 (EIA).
- WTI spot USD 63.06/bbl (weekly, 2025-09-19); flagged WEEKLY_DOWNTREND. Four‑week −1.28%, twelve‑week −11.88%, fifty‑two‑week −5.76% (FRED).
- WTI short‑term averages: 4‑week MA 63.95 vs 13‑week MA 66.84, consistent with recent downward momentum.

Interpretation: These are official FRED and EIA readings dated 2025-09-19; signal reliability is moderate — price series are timely but influenced by transient supply/demand and inventory swings. The small, recent dollar weakening would normally support commodity prices, but Brent’s modest 20‑day gain versus WTI’s clear weekly downtrend and low 5‑year percentiles suggests idiosyncratic oil‑market dynamics (regional supply, inventory flows, or demand softness) are restraining prices. Low percentile ranks for both benchmarks imply limited near‑term upside pressure from oil on inflation.

What to watch:
- USD direction around major US data and Fed commentary (could change commodity import costs).
- OPEC+/supply signals and weekly US crude inventory reports for shifts in oil balances.
- Continuation or reversal of the WTI weekly downtrend and the next monthly demand indicators.

### IX. Fiscal & Saving
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19 the fiscal impulse is tightening (−3.33 pp) because receipts are growing faster than expenditures, yet the headline budget deficit remains large and has worsened.

- Fiscal impulse = −3.33 pp on 2025-09-19: receipts YoY +10.25% vs expenditures YoY +6.93%; headline budget balance −$1,746.8 bn (4‑quarter change −$447.5 bn).
- Government net saving at $5,621.9 bn (SAAR) and net national saving at $3,488.7 bn — both at the 100th percentile in the 5‑year window, indicating elevated levels versus recent history.
- Private net saving $4,766.5 bn (SAAR), up $185.6 bn over the past 12 months (supporting domestic cushioning of demand).
- Real government spending momentum mixed: YoY +1.83% but 2‑quarter annualized −0.38%; government gross fixed investment YoY +4.35% (2‑q ann. 2.72%).

Interpretation: Strong receipts growth through mid‑2025 is mechanically producing a negative fiscal impulse (tightening) even as the nominal deficit remains large and has deteriorated versus the prior year. High percentile readings for government and national net saving reflect elevated levels on a recent historical basis, while private saving has increased modestly—partly offsetting fiscal pressures. Real spending momentum (slightly positive Y/Y but negative over the last two quarters annualized) and continued strength in government fixed investment suggest mixed demand effects.

Data reliability & dating: All series are sourced from FRED (real government spending from GCEC1); values are reported SAAR or YoY as noted and are current as of 2025-09-19.

What to watch:
- Tax/receipts momentum and whether it sustains the current tightening signal.
- Quarterly path of the budget balance (to see if the recent widening continues).
- Real government spending 2‑quarter momentum for signs of renewed fiscal demand.
- Trajectory of private saving and government fixed investment for longer‑run demand/supply effects.

### X. Household Demand & Income
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19, household incomes are rising faster than real spending, but consumption momentum has softened and the saving buffer remains modest.

- Real PCE quantity YoY was 2.62% (2-quarter annualized 1.03%) on 2025-09-19, signaling weaker consumption momentum.
- Personal income (incl. interest) was up 5.01% YoY but the 3-month annualized pace slowed to 1.36% as of 2025-09-19.
- Disposable personal income (DPI) YoY was 4.47% while nominal PCE was up 4.71% (both as of 2025-09-19).
- The personal saving rate was 4.4% on 2025-09-19, little changed over 12 months (+0.1 pp), implying limited additional cushion for households.

Interpretation: These FRED/BEA-sourced indicators (data through 2025-09-19) point to a picture where income growth has so far outpaced real spending, but short-run momentum is decelerating—flags labeled CONSUMPTION_SLOWING and INCOME_SLOWING reflect that the recent 3-month annualized rates are well below the year-over-year figures. Reliability is high for aggregate BEA/FRED series, though monthly/quarterly smoothing can mask near-term swings; the latest readings capture both level (YoY) and momentum (short-run annualized) dynamics.

What to watch:
- Upcoming BEA personal income and PCE releases for confirmation of the 3-month slowdown.
- Trends in interest income and wage growth to see whether income support persists.
- The saving rate trajectory—further rises would cushion spending, declines would amplify downside risk.

### XI. External Sector
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19 the external sector is mixed — goods trade momentum points to an easing external drag over the past six months, but aggregate nominal net exports remain a large and worsening drag on GDP.

- Goods trade balance (goods) was -$78.31 bn as of 2025-09-19, with a six‑month improvement of +$50.49 bn and a roughly unchanged twelve‑month read (+$0.33 bn), signaling recent deficit narrowing.
- Real exports quantity grew modestly: year‑over‑year +1.83% and a 2‑quarter annualized pace of 1.1% (as of 2025-09-19).
- Net exports (NIPA, SAAR) stood at -$869.4 bn as of 2025-09-19, with a four‑quarter deterioration of -$657.6 bn; this series is flagged as a worsening drag.
- Sources: FRED (BEA/BOP) for goods and NIPA measures; coverage and definitions differ across series.

Interpretation: The short‑run picture is mixed but coherent — export volumes are expanding modestly while the goods trade balance has improved over the last six months, yet aggregate nominal net exports have deteriorated sharply on a four‑quarter basis. That divergence likely reflects composition and price effects (coverage differences between goods vs total NIPA, services, primary income, and import price/value changes) rather than a collapse in export volumes. Signal reliability is moderate: these are official FRED/BEA/BOP series, but they capture different parts of the external sector and operate on different vintages and seasonal adjustments; all figures cited are the latest releases dated 2025-09-19.

What to watch:
- Next monthly goods trade release for confirmation of continued deficit narrowing.
- BEA quarterly NIPA updates and revisions that could reconcile nominal net‑exports trends.
- Import prices, commodity prices, and FX moves that could widen or narrow the nominal net‑exports drag.

### XII. Housing & Mortgage
Bottom line: As of June 30, 2025, mortgage affordability remains constrained by elevated 30‑year rates even as home price growth has slowed.

- 30‑year mortgage rate: 6.77% (anchor month: 2025‑06‑30).
- Case‑Shiller home price YoY: +1.86% (2025‑06‑30), indicating much weaker price appreciation than in prior years.
- Existing‑home months’ supply: 4.7 months (2025‑06‑30), implying moderately tight inventory conditions.
- Existing‑home sales: 3.93 million SAAR (2025‑06‑30), reflecting subdued transaction activity.

Interpretation: Data are from FRED (mortgage, Case‑Shiller, NAR) with the anchor date 2025‑06‑30. The slowdown in home price growth reduces one component of affordability pressure, but the 30‑year mortgage rate at 6.77% continues to be the dominant headwind for buyers. Inventory at 4.7 months is below a broad 'balanced' threshold and supports price resilience despite weak appreciation; sales remain muted. Overall reliability is high for these headline series, but monthly volatility in rates and sales can shift near‑term affordability.

What to watch:
- Direction of the 30‑year mortgage rate in coming months and Fed policy signals.
- Subsequent Case‑Shiller releases to confirm whether price easing persists.
- Inventory (months’ supply) and sales trends for signs of loosening or tightening market balance.

### XIII. Crypto
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19, Bitcoin 30‑day implied volatility is unusually low while perpetual funding remains positive — suggesting subdued near‑term fear but persistent long bias.

- BTC 30‑day ATM implied volatility = 34.18% (Deribit) as of 2025-09-19; indicator flagged VOL_LOW and sits at the 5th percentile of the provided historical window.
- Perpetual funding rate = 0.00421% per 8h (Binance) as of 2025-09-19; positive funding favors longs.
- Seven‑day mean funding = 0.00638% per 8h, higher than today’s rate, indicating some easing in long demand over the past week.
- Data providers: Deribit (IV) and Binance (funding).

Interpretation: The combination of low 30‑day IV and still‑positive funding suggests market participants are relatively calm about near‑term tail risk while speculative long exposure remains in place. The IV reading is at a historically low percentile (as of 2025-09-19), so complacency is elevated — a small shock could produce a rapid IV repricing. Funding is positive but has moderated versus the recent 7‑day mean, pointing to a modest retreat in leverage rather than a full position unwind. Confidence in these signals is moderate: exchange-reported funding and option IV are reliable timely indicators, but crypto markets can reprice quickly around liquidity or macro events.

What to watch:
- 30‑day ATM IV moving back above its historical median or rising sharply from 34.18%.
- Funding rate sign or magnitude changes versus the 7‑day mean (watch for sustained increases or flips to negative).
- Spot price moves and on-chain/flow indicators that could trigger rapid IV or funding shifts.

### XIV. Global Monitor
Bottom line: As of 19 September 2025 the ECB policy rate is 2.0% and eurozone HICP inflation is essentially at the ECB's 2% target (2.03% YoY) with a modest month-on-month rise of 0.2%.

Key evidence:
- ECB policy rate = 2.0% (data observation date: 2025-09-19).
- Eurozone HICP inflation = 2.03% year-over-year (latest reading 2025-09-19).
- HICP month-on-month (seasonally adjusted) = +0.2% (2025-09-19).
- Analytical signals flag ECB_NEUTRAL and EU_INFLATION_TARGET (source: FRED).

Interpretation: The simultaneous reading of a 2.0% policy rate and HICP around 2% on 19 September 2025 is consistent with a neutral policy stance: inflation is near target and recent monthly momentum is modestly positive. The signals are drawn from official aggregated series and are timely, but this single snapshot does not capture distributional or sectoral inflation dynamics (for example core vs. energy/food) that could alter near-term risks.

What to watch:
- Upcoming monthly HICP releases for persistence of the +0.2% monthly trend.
- Core inflation and wage growth as indicators of underlying pressure.
- ECB communications and any policy guidance changes after new data.
