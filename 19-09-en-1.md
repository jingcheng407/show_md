## Core Modules
### I. Policy & Path
Bottom line: Policy is in an easing phase with markets pricing a 25 bp cut on Oct 29 and roughly 60 bp of total cuts by late January, even as the EFFR trades unusually above the new target range and IORB, signaling near-term reserve pressures.

- As of Sep 19, 2025, the EFFR is 4.33% versus a 4.00–4.25% target range (midpoint 4.125%), sitting 20.5 bp above the mid and about 8 bp above the top of the range.
- IORB is 4.15% vs EFFR at 4.33%, putting the IORB–EFFR spread at −18 bp on Sep 19; IORB fell 25 bp over the past 20 days.
- For the Oct 29 FOMC, FedWatch implies a 25 bp cut to a 3.875% midpoint as the base case (94.1% probability), with an expected post-meeting EFFR near 3.89%; no-change odds are about 5.9%.
- Over the next three meetings (Oct 29, Dec 10, Jan 28), the market prices about −57.5 bp cumulatively, front-loaded toward 2025.

Interpretation: Official overnight prints (EFFR/IORB) are reliable and show a mechanical tightness in funding—EFFR above IORB and the top of the band—consistent with temporary reserve pressures following a recent rate adjustment. Market-implied paths (FedWatch) strongly favor a 25 bp cut on Oct 29 and further easing into early 2026, but these probabilities can shift with incoming data and Fed communication. All readings are as of Sep 19, 2025.

What to watch:
- Whether EFFR quickly re-enters and stabilizes within the 4.00–4.25% band and the IORB–EFFR gap narrows toward typical levels.
- Persistence (or reversal) of the 25 bp cut odds for Oct 29 and the −50 to −60 bp cumulative path through Jan 28, 2026.
- Any Fed signals on balance sheet/liquidity that could alleviate reserve pressures.

### II. Employment
Bottom line: As of 2025-09-19, the labor market is cooling but not signaling recession.

- Sahm Rule gap is 0.133 pp (well below the 0.5 pp recession trigger) on 2025-09-19; the unemployment rate 3-month average is 4.2% versus a 12-month low of 4.07%.
- Nonfarm payrolls total 159.54 million; payroll momentum has softened with a 3-month annualized growth rate of 0.22% vs 0.48% over 6 months and a 12-month average of 0.95% (flagged LABOR_SLOWING).
- Initial jobless claims are 231,000; the 4-week average is 240,000, down 3,000 from the prior week but up 9,000 versus 52 weeks earlier.

Interpretation: The Sahm Rule—historically a reliable coincident recession signal—remains far from its 0.5 pp threshold, indicating no recession onset signal. Still, payroll momentum has decelerated notably from its 12-month norm, and claims are modestly higher than a year ago, consistent with gradual labor market loosening rather than abrupt deterioration.

What to watch:
- Whether the Sahm gap drifts higher toward 0.5 pp in coming months.
- Subsequent payroll prints to see if 3-month annualized growth stays below the 6-month pace.
- The 4-week average of claims for signs of a sustained uptrend.

### III. Inflation
Inflation is settling in the 2–3% range: core PCE shows only mild upside momentum while market expectations remain anchored near the mid‑2s.

- Core PCE rose 2.88% YoY with a 3-month annualized pace of 2.98% (momentum +0.10 pp) as of Sep 19, 2025.
- Core CPI ran 3.11% YoY versus core PCE at 2.88%—a 0.23 pp gap as of Sep 19, 2025.
- Headline CPI was 2.94% YoY versus headline PCE at 2.60%—a 0.34 pp gap as of Sep 19, 2025.
- Market expectations: 5y breakeven 2.44%, 10y 2.38%, and 5y5y 2.32% (10y down 1 bp over 20 days) as of Sep 19, 2025.

Interpretation: The positive momentum in core PCE is modest, pointing to broadly stable inflation near the high‑2s rather than a clear reacceleration. Breakevens in the 2.3–2.4% zone indicate expectations remain well anchored. The CPI–PCE spreads underscore known index and weight differences that keep CPI slightly hotter. YoY measures are steadier signals; 3‑month annualized metrics and breakevens are timelier but noisier. All readings are as of Sep 19, 2025.

What to watch:
- Whether core PCE’s 3‑month pace holds near ~3% or drifts closer to ~2.5%.
- Narrowing (or widening) of the CPI–PCE gap.
- Breakevens moving out of the 2.3–2.5% band.

### IV. GDP Growth
Bottom line: US growth is near trend (Real GDP +2.8% YoY) but momentum is mixed—consumer/industry roughly flat, private investment edging up, housing weak, and trade a modest near‑term assist; elevated GDP–GDI gaps temper confidence in the signal.

- Real GDP grew 2.8% YoY in the latest quarter (as of Sep 19, 2025), slipping 0.1 pp from the prior quarter.
- Composite momentum from industrial production and real retail sales is essentially neutral at a 0.02 z‑score (INDPRO z −0.23; real retail z +0.27) as of Sep 19, 2025.
- Real private domestic investment shows tentative firming: +0.38% YoY and +3.31% on a 2‑quarter annualized basis (as of Sep 19, 2025).
- External mix: real exports +2.05% YoY (−0.46% 2‑q ann) and real imports +1.27% YoY (−1.61% 2‑q ann) with real net exports at −$1,029.0B SAAR and a +$6.7B four‑quarter improvement (as of Sep 19, 2025).
- Measurement uncertainty is high: GDI outpaced GDP in the quarter (4.8% vs 3.3% q/q SAAR; divergence −1.5 pp) and the statistical discrepancy remains elevated at $7,608.4B SAAR; nominal GDI is up 5.42% YoY (as of Sep 19, 2025).

Interpretation: The YoY growth trend remains solid while near‑term momentum is balanced between modest capex stabilization and a cooling in trade volumes (imports contracting faster than exports). Housing activity remains a drag in the background (composite −8.4% YoY with months’ supply at 9.2). Confidence in point estimates is limited by the sizable GDP–GDI divergence and large statistical discrepancy. Data reflect FRED/BEA releases available as of Sep 19, 2025 and remain subject to revision.

What to watch:
- Whether private investment maintains its 2‑q annualized reacceleration into Q4 2025.
- If import contraction persists, supporting a positive net‑trade contribution despite soft exports.
- Revisions that close (or widen) the GDP–GDI gap and reduce the statistical discrepancy.
- Housing permits/sales for signs the drag is easing.

### VI. Company Earnings
Bottom line: Earnings momentum is cooling even as equity prices break to 5-year highs.

- Corporate profits YoY growth is 4.31% as of 2025-09-19, with 2-quarter annualized momentum at -1.25%; signal: PROFITS_COOLING (momentum down 5.56 pp).
- S&P 500 stands at 6,631.96 on 2025-09-19, at the 100th percentile of its 5-year range with a BREAKOUT_HI tag.
- S&P 500 20-day change is +261.79%.

Interpretation: The corporate profits cycle indicator (from FRED/BEA NIPA; tracks YoY and 2-quarter momentum) currently flags cooling, while the market-based S&P 500 indicator (with 20-day return and breakout tags) shows a breakout. This juxtaposition highlights a gap between price action and earnings momentum at the latest observation date.

What to watch:
- Whether profits momentum (YoY and 2-quarter annualized) stabilizes or weakens further in coming readings.
- Durability of the S&P 500 breakout relative to the profits trend.

## Extended Modules
### VII. Liquidity & Money
Bottom line: Liquidity is broadly neutral while money growth is firming and real rates have fallen and steepened, alongside a sharp drop in front-end yields.

- M2 growth running at 4.82% YoY as of 2025-09-19, with 3-month annualized at 5.82%; M2 level at $22,115.4B.
- Real term structure steep: 5s30s at 121 bp as of 2025-09-19; real yields lower over 20 days (5Y 1.19%, 10Y 1.68%, 30Y 2.40%; changes −22/−26/−24 bp).
- Front-end easing: 6M Treasury yield at 3.8% on 2025-09-19, down 31 bp over 20 days and 47 bp over 60 days—the largest 20D move among UST tenors.
- Fed net-liquidity composite is neutral as of 2025-09-19; balance sheet −$9.8B over 4 weeks, TGA +$0.2B, and RRP usage essentially unchanged over 20 days.

Interpretation: Money stock growth near mid-single digits and falling real yields are supportive for liquidity-sensitive conditions, but the Fed flow proxies show no material net impulse (neutral) at this time. Market-based rate signals are high-frequency and can reverse; M2 is slower-moving, with readings current to 2025-09-19.

What to watch:
- Any sizable swings in WALCL, RRP, or TGA that would tilt the composite away from neutral.
- Whether M2 growth sustains near or above ~5% YoY versus its 3-month pace.
- Persistence of front-end yield declines and the real 5s30s steepening.

### VIII. USD & Commodities
Bottom line: The USD is slightly softer while oil remains weak; WTI is in a clear weekly downtrend and Brent’s modest bounce has not changed the low-price backdrop.

- Trade-weighted USD index at 120.49 on Sep 19, 2025; down 0.56% over 20 days and near its 5-year median (48th percentile).
- Brent crude at $67.88/bbl on Sep 19, 2025; up 0.58% over 20 days but still low vs the past five years (17th percentile).
- WTI at $63.06/bbl on Sep 19, 2025; weekly downtrend signal with declines of 1.28% (4 weeks), 11.88% (12 weeks), and 5.76% (52 weeks); 5-year percentile at 13.
- WTI trades below its 4-week ($63.95) and 13-week ($66.84) averages as of Sep 19, 2025, reinforcing medium-term weakness.

Interpretation: A slightly softer USD offers only marginal support to commodities; the dominant signal is oil weakness, especially in WTI’s weekly trend, while Brent’s small 20-day gain hasn’t altered the low-percentile setup. Weekly trend indicators are more reliable for medium-term direction than short 20-day moves. All readings are as of Sep 19, 2025, benchmarked to 5-year percentiles.

What to watch:
- Whether Brent’s recent uptick fades to align with WTI’s downtrend.
- USD direction from mid-range levels; further softening would be oil-supportive.
- A break of WTI above its 13-week average as a potential trend inflection.

### IX. Fiscal & Saving
Bottom line: Fiscal impulse has turned modestly tightening even as the cash deficit remains large; government demand is soft while private and national saving are elevated.

- As of 2025-09-19, fiscal impulse = -3.33 pp (receipts +10.25% YoY vs outlays +6.93% YoY); budget balance stands at -$1.75T SAAR with a -$447.5B four-quarter deterioration.
- Real government spending is up 1.83% YoY, but the 2-quarter annualized pace is -0.38% (latest level: $3,988.7B in chained 2017 dollars).
- Private net saving is $4,766.5B SAAR, up $185.6B over the past 12 months.
- Net national saving is $3,488.7B SAAR and sits at the top of its 5-year range (percentile 100).
- Government fixed investment is growing 4.35% YoY (2-quarter annualized 2.72%).

Interpretation: The data point to mild near-term fiscal drag (receipts growing faster than outlays) despite a still-large and recently wider deficit. Government demand momentum is soft, but elevated private and national saving provide some cushion. The government net saving metric is at a 5-year high percentile, implying less dissaving versus recent history; however, levels and timing differ across measures (YoY vs SAAR, cash vs NIPA concepts), so cross-metric comparisons should be treated cautiously. Signals reflect FRED/BEA data as of 2025-09-19.

What to watch:
- Whether receipts growth outpaces outlays into Q4 2025, and if the cash deficit narrows.
- Persistence of negative 2-quarter annualized government spending momentum.
- NIPA revisions to private/national saving.
- Follow-through on government fixed investment execution.

### X. Household Demand & Income
Bottom line: Household demand is decelerating as income momentum cools and the saving buffer remains thin, pointing to slower but still positive consumption ahead.

- Real PCE rose 2.62% YoY, but only 1.03% on a 2‑quarter annualized basis, signaling softer momentum (latest: Sep 19, 2025).
- Personal income is up 5.01% YoY, yet the 3‑month annualized pace is 1.36% and flagged as slowing; personal interest income is up 4.77% YoY (Sep 19, 2025).
- The saving rate is 4.4%, up just 0.1pp over 12 months, indicating limited cushion (Sep 19, 2025).
- Nominal PCE growth (4.71% YoY) is slightly outpacing DPI (4.47% YoY), suggesting some stretch given the low saving rate (Sep 19, 2025).

Interpretation: The mix of slower short‑run consumption momentum and a weakening income pulse suggests households are becoming more cautious. With a low saving rate, the shock‑absorbing capacity is limited, though positive YoY growth in both real spending and income implies demand is cooling rather than contracting. Signals are based on BEA/FRED data as of Sep 19, 2025.

What to watch:
- Whether the income 3‑month annualized pace stabilizes or re‑accelerates.
- The trajectory of the saving rate—any further decline would heighten vulnerability.
- Persistence of nominal spending running above DPI, which could pressure savings.

### XI. External Sector
Bottom line: External drag looks mixed—near-term easing via a narrower goods deficit and modest export growth, but the overall net-exports gap remains large and more negative over the past year.

- Goods trade balance at -$78.31bn as of Sep 19, 2025; deficit narrowed by $50.49bn over six months and is roughly flat YoY (+$0.33bn), signaling easing external drag.
- Real exports quantity grew 1.83% YoY (1.1% on a 2-quarter annualized basis) as of Sep 19, 2025, indicating modest export momentum.
- Nominal net exports at -$869.4bn SAAR as of Sep 19, 2025; down by $657.6bn over the past four quarters, implying a larger drag on GDP from trade.

Interpretation: The improvement in the goods deficit suggests recent external drag is easing, but the still-large and more negative net-exports position points to a weak contribution from trade over the past year—likely reflecting import dynamics and price effects beyond goods alone. Signals are timely but volatile (especially balance momentum); real export quantity provides a steadier gauge. All readings are as of Sep 19, 2025.

What to watch:
- Whether the six-month goods deficit improvement persists into late 2025.
- Services balance and import volumes that could offset goods gains.
- USD trend and global demand shaping export prospects.

### XII. Housing & Mortgage
Bottom line: Affordability remains tight as 30-year mortgage rates near 6.8% and lean inventory supports prices, keeping sales subdued.

- 30-year mortgage rate: 6.77% in June 2025.
- Home prices: Case-Shiller up 1.86% year over year in June 2025.
- Inventory: existing-home months’ supply at 4.7 in June 2025 (still lean).
- Demand: existing-home sales at 3.93 million (SAAR) in June 2025.

Interpretation: Elevated borrowing costs continue to pressure monthly payments while limited inventory sustains moderate price appreciation, constraining transaction volumes. Signals are based on FRED/Case‑Shiller and NAR data through June 2025, which are reliable but can be revised; the supply level remains below what’s typically considered a balanced market.

What to watch: trajectory of mortgage rates into H2 2025; whether months’ supply rises toward balance; durability of positive home-price momentum vs affordability headwinds; any pickup in sales as inventory changes.

### XIII. Crypto
Bottom line: BTC options volatility is unusually low while perpetual funding remains modestly positive, signaling a calm, slightly long‑tilted market as of 2025-09-19.

- BTC 30D ATM implied volatility is 34.18% on 2025-09-19, sitting in the 5th percentile of the past 5 years (VOL_LOW signal).
- BTC perpetual funding rate is +0.00421% per 8h on 2025-09-19; the 7-day mean is +0.00638% per 8h, indicating longs are paying shorts.

Interpretation: Derivatives point to suppressed near-term risk pricing (low IV) alongside a mild long bias (positive funding). Such calm regimes can persist but also leave the market vulnerable to outsized moves if a catalyst emerges. These are high-frequency, derivatives-based signals from major venues (Deribit, Binance) and are as of 2025-09-19; intraday swings can occur.

What to watch:
- A sharp rise in 30D IV from depressed percentiles, which would signal repricing of near-term risk.
- Funding flipping negative or spiking higher, indicating shifts in directional positioning and potential liquidation risk.

### XIV. Global Monitor
Bottom line: Eurozone inflation is essentially at target while the ECB policy rate sits at 2%, pointing to a broadly neutral stance as of September 19, 2025.

- ECB policy rate: 2.0% (latest as of 2025-09-19), consistent with a neutral policy setting.
- Eurozone HICP: 2.03% year over year on the latest reading; month-over-month (seasonally adjusted) at 0.2%.
- Analytical signals indicate ECB_NEUTRAL and EU_INFLATION_TARGET, aligning the policy stance with price stability objectives.

Interpretation: With inflation hovering near 2% and the policy rate at 2%, the policy-inflation gap is roughly closed, suggesting neutral real conditions. The data are current to September 19, 2025 and come from standard, reliable sources; the monthly inflation momentum (+0.2% m/m) bears watching for persistence.

What to watch:
- Next HICP prints to gauge whether monthly momentum stays elevated or cools.
- ECB communications for any shift away from neutrality (guidance on rate path and balance sheet).
- Energy and wage dynamics that could tilt inflation slightly above target.
